# Food Ordering Telegram Bot
GiveBis is a bot for telegram-use food order to Giva'at Ram HUJI campus, for both sellers and buyers. 

As a seller - You can add your own restaurant to the system (food type, minimum number af invetions for an order, contact info, etc).

As a buyer - You can post an order from a restaurant, get the order status, cancel your order, etc.

When enough people order food from the same restaurant, one of them is picked randomly. That guy gets a message with all of the order details and the restaurant contact info so he would close the order with them.


This is a project for the course 67118 OPEN-SOURCE WORKSHOP at HUJI
